Simulate data for a P1/N1/P3 component complex.

Note that this function is mainly used for demonstration and internal testing purposes or whenever a quick simulation is needed. \n
In case `n_subjects` is defined - `MixedModelComponents` are generated (multi-subject simulation), else `LinearModelComponents` (single-subject simulation). \n
The most used keyword argument is: `return_epoched = true` which returns already epoched data. If you want epoched data without overlap, specify `onset = NoOnset()` and `return_epoched = true`.

# Keyword arguments

## Design
- `n_repeats = 100`: Number of times the experimental design is repeated. Only used in the single-subject case.
- `n_items = 100`: Number of items. Only used in the multi-subject case.
- `event_order_function = shuffle`: Random trial order. Use `event_order_function = (rng, x) -> x` to deactivate.
- `conditions = Dict(:condition => ["car", "face"], :continuous => range(-5, 5, length = 10))`: Conditions and covariates used in this predefined design.

## Component / Signal
- `sfreq = 100`: Sampling frequency.
- `p1 = (p100(; sfreq = sfreq), @formula(0 ~ 1), [5], Dict())`: P1 with amplitude 5; no effects.
- `n1 = (n170(; sfreq = sfreq), @formula(0 ~ 1 + condition), [5, 3], Dict())`: N1 with amplitude 5, dummy-coded condition effect (levels "car", "face") of 3.
- `p3 = (p300(; sfreq = sfreq), @formula(0 ~ 1 + continuous), [5, 1], Dict())`: P3 with amplitude 5, continuous effect range [-5,5] with slope 1.

## Onset
- `overlap = (0.5,0.2)`, # convenient parameterization for the default `onset::UniformOnset`. (`offset`, `width`) in seconds. If you do not want any overlap, either use `onset=NoOnset()`, or put the offset to a value larger than the maximum used component length, e.g. `overlap=(1,0.2)`. Put the `width` to `0` to have no jitter between events.
- `onset = UniformOnset(; offset = sfreq * 0.5 * overlap[1], width = sfreq * 0.5 * overlap[2])`, 

## Noise
- `noiselevel = 0.2`.
- `noise = PinkNoise(; noiselevel = noiselevel)`.

## Other parameters
- `return_epoched = false`: If true, already epoched data is returned. Otherwise, continuous data is returned.

# Returns
- `(data, events)::Tuple{Array, DataFrame}`: 
    - `data` contains the simulated EEG data.
      Its dimensionality depends on the status of `return_epoched` and whether it's a single- or multisubject simulation (1D, 2D or 3D array):
      `continuous_time`, `continuous_time x n_subjects`, `times x size(design)[1]` or `times x size(design)[1] x n_subjects`. 

    - `events` contains the event combinations based on the experimental design.
      Each row corresponds to one combination of condition/covariate levels which is often equivalent to one stimulus or trial.

    predef_2x2(rng::AbstractRNG; <keyword arguments>)

Simulate data for a 2x2 design i.e. a design with two conditions with two levels each.

Note that this function is mainly used for demonstration and internal testing purposes or whenever a quick simulation is needed. \n

The most used keyword argument is: `return_epoched = true` which returns already epoched data. If you want epoched data without overlap, specify `onset = NoOnset()` and `return_epoched = true`. \n
Be careful if you modify `n_items` with `n_subjects = 1`, `n_items` has to be a multiple of 4 (or your equivalent conditions factorial, e.g. all combinations length).

In difference to `predef_EEG`, `predef_2x2` is sample based (no sampling rate to be specified), and also has a 2x2 design, instead of a 2-categorical, 1-continuous design.

# Keyword arguments

## Design
- `n_items = 100`: Number of items.
- `n_subjects = 1`: Number of subjects.
- `conditions = Dict(:A => ["a_small","a_big"], :B => ["b_tiny","b_large"])`: Experimental conditions with their levels.
- `event_order_function = shuffle`: Random trial order.

## Component / Signal
- `signalsize = 100`: Length of simulated hanning window.
- `basis = hanning(signalsize)`: The actual "function". `signalsize` is only used here.
- `β = [1, -0.5, .5, +1]`: The parameters for the fixed effects.
- `σs = Dict(:subject => [1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],:item => [1])`: Only needed in n_subjects >= 2 cases; specifies the random effects.
- `contrasts = Dict(:A => EffectsCoding(), :B => EffectsCoding())`: Effect coding by default.
- `formula = n_subjects == 1 ? @formula(0 ~ 1 + A*B) : @formula(dv ~ 1 + A*B + (A*B|subject) + (1|item))`: Model formula with interaction.

## Onset
- `overlap = (0.5,0.2)`,
- `onset = UniformOnset(; offset = signalsize * overlap[1], width = signalsize * overlap[2])`, # Put offset to 1 for no overlap. put width to 0 for no jitter

## Noise
- `noiselevel = 0.2`.
- `noise = PinkNoise(; noiselevel = noiselevel)`.

## Other parameters
- `return_epoched = false`: If true, already epoched data is returned. Otherwise, continuous data is returned.

# Returns
- `(data, events)::Tuple{Array, DataFrame}`: 
    - `data` contains the simulated EEG data.
      Its dimensionality depends on the status of `return_epoched` and whether n_subjects >=2:
      `continuous_time`, `continuous_time x n_subjects`, `times x size(design)[1]` or `times x size(design)[1] x n_subjects`. 

    - `events` contains the event combinations based on the experimental design.
      Each row corresponds to one combination of condition levels which is often equivalent to one stimulus or trial.
