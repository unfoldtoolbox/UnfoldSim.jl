Simulate continuous or epoched signal, given `design`, [Array of] `component`, `onset` and 
optional `noise` and `rng`. Main simulation function.

# Arguments
- `rng::AbstractRNG` (optional): Random number generator, important to ensure reproducibility.
- `design::AbstractDesign`: Desired experimental design.
- `components`: `Component`(s) for the desired signal.
- `onset::AbstractOnset`: Desired inter-onset distance distribution.
- `noise::AbstractNoise = NoNoise()` (optional): Desired noise.

# Keyword arguments
- `return_epoched::Bool = false`: If set to `true` epoched data is returned, otherwise a continuous signal is returned (see also Notes below).

# Returns
- `(signal, events)::Tuple{Array, DataFrame}`:
    - `signal` : Generated signal. Depending on the design, on the components and on 
        `return_epoched`, the output can be a 1-D, 2-D, 3-D or 4-D Array. 
        For example, a 4-D Array would have the dimensions `channels x time x trials x subjects`.
    - `events`: Generated events data frame with latencies.

```

# Notes
Some remarks on how the noise is added:
- If `return_epoched = true` and `onset = NoOnset()` the noise is added to the epoched data matrix.
- If `onset` is not `NoOnset`, a continuous signal is created and the noise is added to this 
    i.e. this means that the noise won't be the same as in the `onset = NoOnset()` case even if `return_epoched = true`.
- The case `return_epoched = false` and `onset = NoOnset()` is not possible and therefore 
    covered by an assert statement.

Additional remarks on the overlap of adjacent signals when `return_epoched = true`:
- If `onset = NoOnset()` there will not be any overlapping signals in the data because the onset calculation and conversion to a continuous signal is skipped.
- If an inter-onset distance distribution is given, a continuous signal(potentially with overlap) is constructed and partitioned into epochs afterwards.
