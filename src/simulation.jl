Main simulation function, given `Design`, [Array of] `Component`, `Onset` and optional [`Noise`], returns continuous or epoched signal.

## optional
- `return_epoched` (Bool, default: `false`):  Skip the Onset-calculation and conversion to continuous data and return the epoched data directly (see also remarks below).

## Return 
Depending on the design, the components and on `return_epoched`, the output can be a 1-D, 2-D, 3-D or 4-D Array. For example, a 4-D Array would have the dimensions `channels x time x trials x subjects`

## Notes
Some remarks to how the noise is added:
  - If `return_epoched = true` and `onset =NoOnset()` the noise is added to the epoched data matrix
  - If `onset` is not `NoOnset`, a continuous signal is created and the noise is added to this i.e. this means that the noise won't be the same as in the `onset = NoOnset()` case even if `return_epoched = true`.
  - The case `return_epoched = false` and `onset = NoOnset()` is not possible and therefore covered by an assert statement
