    UniformOnset <: AbstractOnset

Provide a Uniform Distribution for the inter-event distances (in samples).

Tip: To manually generate inter-event distance samples use the [`simulate_interonset_distances`](@ref) function.

# Fields
- `width = 50` (optional): Width of the uniform distribution (=> the "jitter"). Since the lower bound is 0, `width` is also the upper bound.
- `offset = 0` (optional): The minimal distance between events. The maximal distance is `offset + width`.

# Examples
```julia-repl
julia> onset_distribution = UniformOnset(width = 25, offset = 5)
UniformOnset
  width: Int64 25
  offset: Int64 5
```

See also [`LogNormalOnset`](@ref), [`NoOnset`](@ref).

@with_kw struct UniformOnset <: AbstractOnset
    width = 50 # how many samples jitter?
    offset = 0 # minimal offset?
end
"""
    LogNormalOnset <: AbstractOnset

Log-normal inter-event distances (in samples) using the `Distributions.jl` truncated LogNormal distribution ([code and mathematical reference](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/univariate/#Distributions.LogNormal)).

Be careful with large `μ` and `σ` values, as they are on logscale. σ>8 can quickly give you out-of-memory sized signals! \\
Tip: To manually generate inter-event distance samples use the [`simulate_interonset_distances`](@ref) function.

# Fields
- `μ`: The mean of the log-transformed variable (the log-normal random variable's logarithm follows a normal distribution).
- `σ`: The standard deviation of the log-transformed variable.
- `offset = 0` (optional): The minimal distance between events.
- `truncate_upper = nothing` (optional): Upper limit (in samples) at which the distribution is truncated.

# Examples
```julia-repl
julia> onset_distribution = LogNormalOnset(3, 0.25, 10, 25)
LogNormalOnset
  μ: Int64 3
  σ: Float64 0.25
  offset: Int64 10
  truncate_upper: Int64 25
```

    σ::Any  # variance
    offset = 0 # additional offset
    truncate_upper = nothing # truncate at some sample?
end

"""
    NoOnset <: AbstractOnset

For cases where the user wants to simulate epoched data without any overlap between consecutive events.

# Examples
```julia-repl
julia> onset_distribution = NoOnset()
NoOnset()
```

"""
    simulate_interonset_distances(rng, onset::AbstractOnset, design::AbstractDesign)

Generate the inter-onset distance vector by sampling from the respective distribution (in samples).

# Arguments
- `rng`: Random number generator (RNG) to make the process reproducible.
- `onset::AbstractOnset`: Inter-onset distance distribution to sample from.
- `design::AbstractDesign`: Experimental design with conditions and covariates.

# Returns
- `Vector{Integer}`: Inter-onset distances in samples. Note that these are distances between onsets and no latencies.

# Examples
```julia-repl
# Create an experimental design
julia> design_single = SingleSubjectDesign(;
           conditions = Dict(
               :stimulus_type => ["natural", "artificial"],
               :contrast_level => range(0, 1, length = 3),
           ),
       );

# Create an inter-onset distance distribution
julia> onset_distribution = LogNormalOnset(3, 0.5, 5, nothing);

"""
    simulate_onsets(rng, onset::AbstractOnset, simulation::Simulation)

Call `simulate_interonset_distances` to generate distances between events and then add them up to generate the actual latencies in samples.

Please note that this function is mainly for internal use in the context of `simulate` function calls. \n
Also note that the accumulation of onsets starts at 1 to avoid indexing problems in the case that the first sampled onset is 0.

# Arguments
- `rng`: Random number generator (RNG) to make the process reproducible.
- `onset::AbstractOnset`: Inter-onset distance distribution which is passed to `simulate_interonset_distances`.
- `simulation::Simulation`: Simulation object which contains design, component(s), inter-onset distance distribution and noise.

# Returns

# Examples
```julia-repl
# Create Simulation object
julia> design_single = SingleSubjectDesign(;
           conditions = Dict(
               :stimulus_type => ["natural", "artificial"],
