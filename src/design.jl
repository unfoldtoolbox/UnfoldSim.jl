    MultiSubjectDesign <: AbstractDesign

A type for specifying the experimental design for multiple subjects (based on the given random-effects structure).

### Fields
- `n_subjects`::Int -> number of subjects
- `n_items`::Int -> number of items (sometimes ≈trials)
- `subjects_between` = Dict{Symbol,Vector} -> effects between subjects, e.g. young vs old 
- `items_between` = Dict{Symbol,Vector} -> effects between items, e.g. natural vs artificial images, (but shown to all subjects if not specified also in `subjects_between`)
- `both_within` = Dict{Symbol,Vector}	-> effects completly crossed
- `event_order_function = (rng, x) -> x`; # can be used to sort, or e.g. `(rng, x) -> shuffle(rng, x)` (or shorter just `event_order_function = shuffle`)

Tip: Check the resulting dataframe using the [`generate_events`](@ref) function.


### Example
```julia
# declaring same condition both sub-between and item-between results in a full between subject/item design
design = MultiSubjectDesign(;
		n_items = 10,
		n_subjects = 30,
		subjects_between = Dict(:cond => ["levelA", "levelB"]),
		items_between = Dict(:cond => ["levelA", "levelB"]),
		);
```

    n_subjects::Int
    n_items::Int
    subjects_between::Dict{Symbol,Vector} = Dict()
    items_between::Dict{Symbol,Vector} = Dict()
    both_within::Dict{Symbol,Vector} = Dict()
    event_order_function = (rng, x) -> x
end


"""
    SingleSubjectDesign <: AbstractDesign

A type for specifying the experimental for a single subject (based on the given conditions).

### Fields
- `conditions = Dict{Symbol,Vector}`` of conditions, e.g. `Dict(:A=>["a_small","a_big"],:B=>["b_tiny","b_large"])`
- `event_order_function` = (rng::AbstractRNG,x::DataFrame)->x; # can be used to sort by specifying `sort`, or shuffling by providing `shuffle`, or custom functions following the interface `(rng,x)->my_shuffle(rng,x)`

Number of trials / rows in `generate_events([rng, ]design)` depend on the full factorial of your `conditions`.

To increase the number of repetitions simply use `RepeatDesign(SingleSubjectDesign(...),5)`

If conditions are omitted (or set to `nothing`), a single trial is simulated with a column `:dummy` and content `:dummy` - this is for convenience.

Tip: Check the resulting dataframe using the [`generate_events`](@ref) function.

### Examples
```julia
design = SingleSubjectDesign(;
    conditions = Dict(
        :stimulus_type => ["natural", "artificial"],
        :contrast_level => range(0, 1, length = 5),
);

    generate_events([rng::AbstractRNG, ]design::SingleSubjectDesign)

Generates full-factorial DataFrame of design.conditions

Generate full factorial Dataframe according to MixedModelsSim.jl 's `simdat_crossed` function.

Note: `n_items` = you can think of it as `trials` or better, as `stimuli`.
Note: No condition can be named `dv` which is used internally in MixedModelsSim / MixedModels as a dummy left-side
Afterwards applies `design.event_order_function`. Could be used to duplicate trials, sort, subselect etc.
Finally it sorts by `:subject`
