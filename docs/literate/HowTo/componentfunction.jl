# Instead of defining a boring vector basis function e.g. `[0,0,1,2,3,3,2,1,0,0,0]`, let's use function, generating random values for now.
# !!! important
#     because any function depending on `design` can be used, two things have to be taken care of:
#     
#     1. in case a random component exist, specify a `RNG`, the basis might be evaluated multiple times inside `simulate`
#     2. a `maxlength` has to be specified via a tuple `(function.maxlength)``
